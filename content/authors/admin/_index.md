## About Me

I am a third-year student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, currently working as a research assistant at BKAI Laboratory and as an AI Engineer at VC Corporation. My research focuses on natural language processing, specifically on the problem of Speech Emotion Recognition. Additionally, I am exploring Mixture of Experts for scalable AI problems.
